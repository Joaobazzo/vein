## Vein Package

**V**ehicular **E**missions **IN**ventory **(VEIN)** model.  



Read the DESCRIPTION file. You need several packages to run **vein**.

- sp
- units
- raster
- rgdal
- rgeos

Also, if you want to properly run the demo, install these packages:

- ggplot2
- DiagrammeR
- RColorBrewer


```{r eval=F}
library(devtools)
install_github("ibarraespinosa/vein")
library(vein)
demo("VEIN")
```

I've created the following classes:

- Vehicles
- Speed
- EmissionFactors
- EmissionFactorsList
- Emissions
- EmissionsArray
- EmissionsList

Each class has the methods print, plot and summary.

The units are still not fully implemented and now i'm hunting bugs and erros in documentation. Regarding the documentation of the emission factors, it will be added several information.

I hope you enjoy it
